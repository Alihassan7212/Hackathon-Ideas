# 1) Shaking-based SOS
## Overview:
Shaking-based SOS is an emergency response system designed to provide quick assistance to users in critical situations. Users can trigger an emergency alert by shaking their phones, automatically notifying the police and pre-defined emergency contacts. The system utilizes location data to map and track these incidents. This information is then used to create a public map highlighting areas with frequent emergency activities, helping to raise awareness and improve community safety.

## Features:
Shake-triggered emergency alerts
Automatic notification to police and emergency contacts
Real-time mapping and tracking of emergency incidents
Community awareness through a public map
## Technologies:
Mobile app development (Android/iOS)
GPS/location tracking
Emergency alert system
Map integration
